I was participating in the salary prediction competition (給与推定コンペ), held by ProbSpace. (URL: [Here](https://prob.space/competitions/salary-prediction))

The results came out, I didn't do that great, but since it was my first time ever joining a ML competition, I'd like to jot down the things I did, things that worked and that didn't.

## Result
The result was 48th/192. Not great, no medals.

## Pipeline
The pipeline is shown below.

I think the major reasons why I couldn't improve my score was,

* The 4 models were all tree-based, so stacking didn't work so well
* Although I made about 30-50 new features, that wasn't enough

Overall, I think the whole flow of the pipeline was not too bad, I needed to do more feature engineering. I could've used neural networks too.
