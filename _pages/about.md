I am currently a senior student at University of Tokyo, Department of Systems Innovations. I am interested in applying ML/DL to other fields, such as medicine, public health, and economics. I am currently working on a project combining public health and RL. My goal is to understand more about how we think and how we see the world through understanding machines. On my free time, I play the violin.
